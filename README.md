What is the MERN stack?

MERN stack is a web development framework. It consists of MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS as its working components. Here are the details of what each of these components is used for in developing a web application when using MERN stack:

- MongoDB â€” a document-oriented, No-SQL database used to store the application data.
- Express(.js) â€” a framework layered on top of NodeJS, used to build the backend of a site using NodeJS functions and structures.
- React(.js) â€” a client-side JavaScript framework. It is a library created by Facebook and it's used to build UI components that create the user interface of the single page web application.
- Node(.js) â€” is a single-threaded, open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for building fast and scalable server-side and networking applications.
